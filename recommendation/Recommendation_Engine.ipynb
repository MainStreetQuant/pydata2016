    "1. **Content-based rating:** We can make this guess based only on features of the users or items.\n",

We will be building applications that attempts to present movies that a given user would rate highly.  The following cell will download and extract the data to the `projects/ml-10M100K/` directory."

The `NearestNeighbors` assumes that the closest points are the ones for which the [Minkowski Distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minkowski_distance) is minimized.  That is, if we have two rows of our feature vector $X_{i\\cdot}$ and $X_{j\\cdot}$, it minimizes\n",
    "$$ \\|X_{i\\cdot} - X_{j\\cdot}\\|_p^p = \\sum_k \\left(X_{ik} - X_{jk}\\right)^p $$\n",
    "By default, it computes $p=2$, which is the [Euclidean distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance)."

    "There are several methods of **dimensional reduction** that attempt to pull out a lower-dimensional structure.  We'll be using Truncated Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), which works well with sparse matrices.  (Other methods include PCA, NMF, etc.)  SVD attempts to find orthogonal directions within feature space, along which the feature matrix has the most variation.  Recall that for $X$, an $n \\times p$ feature matrix, we have the [Singular Value Decomposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_value_decomposition) with\n",

    "\n",
    "One way to balance these two competing needs is to introduce a **Bayesian prior**.  This is the estimate we make that every movie has a rating $\\mu$, before seeing any of the user ratings.  As we see ratings from users come it, we formulate a **posterior** estimate of the rating, taking into account both the prior and the new information provided by the ratings.  The posterior estimate of the rating, after seeing the $n$ reviews $\\{x_i\\}$, can be written as\n",

    "$$ \\frac{ \\sum_{i=0}^n x_i + \\mu N}{n + N} \\ , $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $N$ reflects our level of confidence in the prior.  Adjusting $N$ affects the number of user reviews needed to push the posterior estimate away from $mu$.  Adjusting $mu$ affects where in the rankings movies with few reviews appear.  This technique is known as [Bayesian Smoothing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Additive_smoothing).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, we use $\\mu = 3$, $N = 5$, essentially starting each movie off with five reviews of three stars.  The top rated movies are all ones reviewed by our user.  Looking a little bit down the list, we see a recommendation for *The Thing*, which seems very reasonable.  *Ghostbusters* also ranks highly.  This is somewhat surprising, since our user didn't rate any comedies.  Evidently, other fans of horror films like *Ghostbusters* anyway, so maybe our user should give it a try."

    "This discrepancy is a sign that we may be overfitting.  Training data is never perfectly clean.  It contains both the underlying signal, which you want to model, and some random noise, which you do not.  Since our model has over 11K parameters, it has plenty of flexibility to fit the noise as well as the signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "The noise in this case is the same issue that prompted us to use a Bayesian mean to rate the movies suggested by neighbor users.  Prior to seeing any ratings for a item, for example, we would expect $b_i = 0$.  After seeing a single rating $r$, we shouldn't set $b_i = r - mu$.  Instead, we should update our estimate or $b_i$ somewhat in between these values, depending on our confidence in the prior.\n",
    "\n",
    "While we could add in these prior ratings by hand, we can use regularization to produce the same effect.  Recall that in ridge regression, we add a term proportional to $\\beta^2$ to the quantity being minimized:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\left|y - X\\cdot\\beta\\right|^2 + \\alpha\\ \\left|\\beta\\right|^2 \\ . $$\n",

Linear regression is a good way to automatically perform a weighted average together.  The BellKor team had success with **gradient-boosted trees** as blenders.\n",
